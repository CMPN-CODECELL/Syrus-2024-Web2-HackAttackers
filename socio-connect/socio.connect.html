                <h2>Brush Strokes of Remembrance</h2>
                <p>Helen, a 68-year-old retired school teacher diagnosed with early-stage Alzheimer’s, discovers a newfound love for painting. Through her story, we explore how picking up a brush not only helps her maintain her motor skills but also becomes a medium for her to express her emotions and memories, which she struggles to communicate verbally. Her family sets up a blog on "Voices of Memory" where they share Helen’s artwork and the stories behind each piece, creating a vibrant tapestry of her life and inspiring others to find creative outlets for expression.</p>

            <h2>Capturing Moments: A Son’s Promise</h2>
            <p>Michael, whose father has Alzheimer’s, starts a digital diary to document their journey together after his father’s diagnosis. This diary evolves into a collection of short stories, photographs, and videos that capture both the challenges and the moments of joy, such as spontaneous laughter over breakfast or serene walks in the park. Michael’s entries on "Voices of Memory" offer a son’s perspective on caregiving, shedding light on the emotional rollercoaster that many caregivers experience, and the strength found in vulnerability.</p>
